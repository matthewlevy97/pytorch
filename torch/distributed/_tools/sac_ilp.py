    MILP to decide which modules to AC and how much memory to discard.
    The objective is to minimize recomputation time.
    The constraint is to ensure peak memory is under budget.

    Args:
        graph: graph representation of the model as a module submodule tree
            where each node is a submodule with memory & runtime stats
        memory_budget: memory budget in GiB
        world_size: number of GPUs. In the case of FSDP, world_size will be
            used to compute the amount of parameter and gradient memory on each rank
        ac_units: a list of user-specified AC units.
        fsdp_units: a list of FSDP units. AC units cannot be supermodules of FSDP units.
